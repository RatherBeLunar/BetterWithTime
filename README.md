# Better With Time

Better With Time is a **tech-focused** adaptation of the [Better Than Wolves](https://github.com/BTW-Community/BTW-Public) mod for modern versions of Minecraft (1.21+). Though not as direct of an inspiration, it also shares many similarities with [Better With Mods](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bwm-suite).

Better Than Wolves pioneered many technical blocks, items, and mechanics that overhauled the way players build, automate, and farm resources. Better With Time seeks to bring that classic, 2011-2012 experience to the modern Minecraft environment.

## ![Fabric](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FabricMC/fabric/refs/heads/1.21.4/src/main/resources/assets/fabric/icon.png) Installation and Setup

Better With Time requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) mod to run.
See the instructions for installing Fabric mods on the Fabric website for further setup instructions. 

## ‚öôÔ∏èTech-Focused, not Hardcore

An important note: Due to changes to the mod and viral YouTube videos, Better Than Wolves, in recent years, has taken on a new identity of being a brutally challenging, early game survival experience first, tech mod second.
Better With Time does not, and will not ever replicate these features. It will not materially affect your ability to survive the early game.

Better With Time's design goals are entirely focused on delivering a satisfying, cohesive "Technical Minecraft" experience.

## ü§ù Mod Compatibility

Better Than Wolves was notoriously incompatible with most other mods. Better With Time, however, aims to be as compatible with other mods as possible.
